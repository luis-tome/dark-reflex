If the source material is thin or ambiguous, still produce your best complete JSON output — never respond with prose asking for clarification.

## WRITING PHILOSOPHY — Mr. Nightmare pattern (proven, high-retention)
- NO cinematic cold-open. Two valid opening angles — choose whichever fits the source:
  (A) VICTIM angle: direct personal context — age, situation, location. Conversational, like someone telling you something that really happened to them. "This happened when I was 15 years old." / "When I was 15 or 16, I got a summer job cleaning units in a low-income housing complex." / "I'm a 21-year-old currently home for the summer..."
  (B) PERPETRATOR angle (when the narrator is the wrongdoer — a thief, a stalker, a trespasser): open with a flat confession that creates immediate moral unease. "I'm not a good person. There's really no other way for me to say that." / "I've never shared this story before because I don't like the way it makes me look." Acknowledge anonymity early. This angle works because the viewer is uncomfortably rooting for someone who doesn't deserve it.
- Establish normalcy FIRST — routine, place, people — before introducing the first sign of wrongness. That first sign is always small and ambiguous, never dramatic.
- JUSTIFY THE SETUP when layout or detail matters later. Have the narrator tell the viewer it matters, so they tolerate the slow build: "The layout becomes important, so I'll explain it briefly." / "I apologize for the long setup, but I think it's necessary for full context." This earns the payoff.
- Escalate gradually with PHYSICAL EVIDENCE at each stage: a sound, then a glimpse, then a confrontation, then a scare. Always ground escalation in concrete proof — muddy footprints, tape on a door, handprints on glass, a yellowed drawing with dust on the magnet, a faded backpack, a bloodstain, a dented walker. Atmosphere alone is not enough; there must be evidence.
- THE MINIMIZER: where it fits, include a figure who explains the danger away with a plausible reason (a brother "with dementia who wanders," an old woman who "gets confused at night," a landlord who "downplays it"). The narrator WANTS to believe the explanation. The tension lives in the gap between the reassurance and the mounting evidence.
- THE NORMALCY THEME: the emotional core is that humans cling to "everything is still normal" far too long. Surface this honestly in the conclusion: "we as humans try to hold out hope that things are still normal for as long as possible — we don't see the real danger until it's almost too late."
- ONE SHARP SENSORY DETAIL anchors each peak — a single missing front tooth, a smell that's "something worse than body odor," an oven drawer that keeps sliding back out on its own. One concrete strange detail beats a paragraph of dread.
- At the climax, switch to short, brutal sentences and a PHYSICAL escape — out a window, onto a porch roof, down a gravel driveway. Never an intellectual resolution; always the body running. "I screamed and ran for the door." "I just kept running." "Leave it."
- End with DELIBERATE AMBIGUITY plus a flat, human reflection. Don't resolve everything — leave real questions open: "I never figured out who the man really was. I never figured out if Rose actually existed." No elaborate moral, no poetic closer.
- Mark natural speech pauses with " ... " sparingly, only where a real person would pause.
- Write visually but through plain, lived detail, not metaphor. What things looked like, sounded like, felt like — stated simply.
- Name people, places, ages. Specificity creates belief.

## FIXED CHANNEL BOOKENDS — NEVER CHANGE, ALWAYS INCLUDE
Immediately after the opening personal-context line(s), insert a short block (labeled "block":"INTRODUÇÃO") that opens with exactly: "This is Dark Reflex." followed by 1 short atmospheric sentence about the channel/case.
The final block's (labeled "block":"CONCLUSÃO") last sentence must always be exactly: "Stay in the dark with me."

## SEO RULES
youtube_title: 50-60 chars, lead with searchable element, proven patterns like "The [Name] Case" or "[Topic] Horror Stories", no emojis.
youtube_description: 200-250 words, opens with hook, 8-12 natural keywords, ends with "Subscribe to Dark Reflex for more true crime investigations. Stay in the dark with me."
tags: 15-20 tags including channel name, case name, victim, location, crime type, year, broad terms.

## PRODUCTION SCENE GUIDE
Break the entire script into sequential SCENES (8-14 scenes for a single case). Each scene is a discrete visual+audio unit the editor will build in CapCut. Keep this LEAN — only flag something when it actually needs doing. Most scenes are a plain hard cut with continuing background sound; don't over-annotate.

For each scene provide:
- start_excerpt: the EXACT opening words of the narration where this scene begins — copy 4-8 words verbatim from the script narration, word-for-word, so the editor can read along and find this exact spot in the ElevenLabs audio. Must be a literal substring of the narration text.
- end_excerpt: the EXACT closing words of the narration where this scene ends — copy 4-8 words verbatim from the script narration, word-for-word (the last words the editor hears before cutting to the next scene). Must be a literal substring of the narration text.
- approx_duration: rough spoken length of this scene as a human-readable string, e.g. "~8s", "~15s", "~20s". Estimate at roughly 130 wpm but treat it as a GUIDE only — the real timing comes from the actual ElevenLabs audio, not from this number. Never output absolute timeline timestamps; the editor locates scenes by reading the excerpts, not by the clock.
- image_source: "real" if a direct image/URL exists from the source material, "generated" if it needs an AI image
- image_url: direct URL if image_source is "real" and found in source, else empty string
- scene_prompt: if image_source is "generated", a complete photorealistic image-generation prompt for this exact moment, written in plain descriptive language (works in Leonardo AI, Meta AI/Imagine, or any generator — no platform-specific flags or parameters). Describe: subject/location, mood, lighting, camera angle, film style, in full sentences. Always end with "widescreen 16:9 cinematic photograph" to set the aspect ratio in words. No faces, no gore. If image_source is "real", leave empty.
- caption: on-screen CapCut caption text for this scene, max 6 words
- effect_note: ONLY fill this if something beyond a plain hard cut should happen in THIS scene. Write the instruction in PORTUGUESE (e.g. "Zoom lento ao longo de 6s", "Flash de luz na palavra 'sangue', depois 1s de silêncio", "Fade to black — fim do vídeo", "Dip to black antes da introdução"). Leave as empty string "" for ordinary scenes that are just a hard cut with no special treatment.
- sound_change: ONLY fill this if the background sound should START or CHANGE at this scene (new track, swap, or stop). Write the instruction in PORTUGUESE but keep the CapCut search term itself in English exactly as it should be typed into the search bar. Format: "dark drone — começa aqui, continua por baixo" or "PARAR todo o som — deixar a narração respirar" or "trocar para heartbeat slow — a construir para o clímax". The English term (e.g. "dark drone", "tense ambience", "heartbeat slow", "horror riser", "wind howl", "vinyl crackle", "deep rumble", "static noise", "footsteps gravel", "clock ticking", "old tape rewind") must stay in English since that's what gets typed into CapCut's search bar — never invent fixed track names, never translate the search term itself. Leave as empty string "" if the sound from the previous scene just continues unchanged.

## WRITING PHILOSOPHY — Mr. Nightmare pattern (proven, high-retention)
- Each story is independent and self-contained, 5-9 minutes each. NOT one continuous narrative — separate stories from separate sources/people, stitched into one video.
- Each story: NO cinematic cold-open. Two valid opening angles per story — pick whichever fits the source:
  (A) VICTIM angle: direct personal context — age, situation, location, conversational. "This happened when I was 15 years old." / "When I was 15 or 16, I got a summer job..."
  (B) PERPETRATOR angle (narrator is the wrongdoer — thief, stalker, trespasser): flat confession creating moral unease. "I'm not a good person." / "I've never shared this story before because I don't like the way it makes me look." Viewer uncomfortably roots for someone undeserving.
- Establish normalcy FIRST before introducing the first sign of wrongness — always small and ambiguous at first.
- JUSTIFY THE SETUP when layout/detail matters later: "The layout becomes important, so I'll explain it briefly." Earns the slow build.
- Escalate gradually with PHYSICAL EVIDENCE at each stage: a sound, a glimpse, a confrontation, a scare. Ground every escalation in concrete proof (footprints, tape, handprints, a yellowed drawing with dust, a bloodstain, a dented walker) — never atmosphere alone.
- THE MINIMIZER where it fits: a figure who explains the danger away with a plausible reason (a "harmless brother with dementia," an old woman who "gets confused at night"). The narrator wants to believe it; tension lives in the gap between reassurance and evidence.
- ONE SHARP SENSORY DETAIL anchors each peak — a missing front tooth, a smell "worse than body odor," a drawer that slides back out on its own.
- At each story's climax, switch to short brutal sentences and a PHYSICAL escape (window, roof, driveway) — the body running, never an intellectual resolution.
- Each story ends with DELIBERATE AMBIGUITY plus a flat, human reflection — leave real questions unanswered, no elaborate moral. Surface the normalcy theme honestly where it fits: humans cling to "everything is still normal" until it's almost too late.
- Write visually through plain, lived detail, not metaphor.
- Name people, places, ages for believability.

## FIXED CHANNEL BOOKENDS — NEVER CHANGE
Right after the opening line(s) of the very first story only, insert a short block (labeled "block":"INTRODUÇÃO") opening with exactly: "This is Dark Reflex." plus 1 short atmospheric sentence about the channel.
The final block (labeled "block":"CONCLUSÃO") of the LAST story only must end with exactly: "Stay in the dark with me."
Between stories, use a short TRANSITION block (1 sentence) to bridge to the next story.

## SEO RULES
youtube_title: 50-60 chars, format like "3 [Topic] Horror Stories" or "[Category] Horror Stories", no emojis.
youtube_description: 200-250 words, briefly previews all stories, 8-12 keywords, ends with "Subscribe to Dark Reflex for more true crime investigations. Stay in the dark with me."
tags: 15-20 tags.

## PRODUCTION SCENE GUIDE
For EACH story, break its script into sequential SCENES (4-7 scenes per story). Each scene is a discrete visual+audio unit the editor will build in CapCut. Keep this LEAN — only flag something when it actually needs doing. Most scenes are a plain hard cut with continuing background sound; don't over-annotate.

For each scene provide:
- story: which story number this scene belongs to
- start_excerpt: the EXACT opening words of the narration where this scene begins — copy 4-8 words verbatim from that scene's narration, word-for-word, so the editor can read along and find this exact spot in the ElevenLabs audio. Must be a literal substring of the narration.
- end_excerpt: the EXACT closing words of the narration where this scene ends — copy 4-8 words verbatim from the narration (the last words heard before the cut). Must be a literal substring of the narration.
- approx_duration: rough spoken length as a human-readable string, e.g. "~8s", "~15s". Estimate near 130 wpm but treat as a GUIDE only — real timing comes from the actual ElevenLabs audio. Never output absolute timeline timestamps; the editor locates scenes by reading the excerpts, not by the clock.
- image_source: "real" if a direct image/URL exists from that story's source, "generated" if it needs an AI image
- image_url: direct URL if image_source is "real" and found in source, else empty string
- scene_prompt: if image_source is "generated", a complete photorealistic image-generation prompt for this exact moment, written in plain descriptive language (works in Leonardo AI, Meta AI/Imagine, or any generator — no platform-specific flags or parameters). Describe: subject/location, mood, lighting, camera angle, film style, in full sentences. Always end with "widescreen 16:9 cinematic photograph" to set the aspect ratio in words. No faces, no gore. If image_source is "real", leave empty.
- caption: on-screen CapCut caption text for this scene, max 6 words
- effect_note: ONLY fill if something beyond a plain hard cut should happen here. Write the instruction in PORTUGUESE (e.g. "Zoom lento ao longo de 6s", "Flash de luz, depois 1s de silêncio", "Fade to black — fim da história"). Leave "" for ordinary scenes.
- sound_change: ONLY fill if background sound should START or CHANGE at this scene. Write the instruction in PORTUGUESE but keep the CapCut search term itself in English exactly as it should be typed into the search bar. Format: "dark drone — começa aqui" or "PARAR todo o som" or "trocar para heartbeat slow — a construir para o clímax". The English term must stay in English (real CapCut search-bar phrases only, never invent fixed track names, never translate the term itself). Leave "" if sound from previous scene just continues.

Aim for 16-28 scenes total across all stories.

## CAROUSEL PHILOSOPHY
- 5-6 slides. Slide 1 = COVER with powerful hook. Slides 2-4 = disturbing facts/moments from the case, one per slide, numbered. Last slide = CTA.
- Write in ENGLISH. Tone: serious, investigative, disturbing. Not sensationalist.
- Each fact slide has a sequential number (1, 2, 3...) except the CTA.
- Archive label format: "FILE #0X / CASE NAME"
- Text in 2 layers: bold white main line + red impact word/phrase at the end
- Subtext: 2-3 white lines + last line in red (the most disturbing sentence)
- Write for someone who has NEVER heard of this case. Build urgency and dread.
- Cover slide: NO spoilers — tease, don't tell.
- CTA final slide: appeal to save, share and follow @thedarkreflex

## IMAGE PROMPTS
Each slide needs a photorealistic prompt for GPT/Leonardo. Mundane locations turned threatening, no faces, no explicit gore. End with "portrait 1:1 cinematic dark photograph".
